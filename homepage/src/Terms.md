# Terms and Conditions

## Introduction

The PureScript Domain is a free vanity URL service (the "Service") owned and operated by Nicholas Saunders (hereafter "we", "our", or "us"). A URL path name (the "Site") is automatically created for each package registered in the [PureScript Registry](https://github.com/purescript/registry), consisting of the package name and redirecting to the corresponding GitHub repository. A secondary registration method is via [pull request](https://github.com/purescript-domain/purescript-domain/edit/main/sites.yaml) to the _purescript-domain_ GitHub repository. Use of the Service, whether by active promotion of the Site or through explicit participation via pull request, is subject to your acknowledgment and acceptance of these Terms and Conditions (hereafter the "Agreement").

## Rights and responsibilities

You are responsible for maintaining Site content, ensuring that it complies with the Content Policy described herein at all times. We reserve the right to deactivate the Site if it references content that we determine, in our sole discretion, violates this policy.

The Service is provided by us on a voluntary basis. You acquire no ownership or other rights to the Service or to the Site.

While we strive to maintain the reliability of the Service, we necessarily reserve the right to modify or to discontinue the Service at any time, for any reason, without notice.

## Content Policy

Only content that is relevant to the PureScript community is permitted. Examples of acceptable content include, but are not limited to, PureScript library documentation, tools, and community resources.

Content that is illegal, obscene, indecent, or defamatory; incites racial or ethnic hatred; or violates the rights of others is expressly forbidden.

## Termination

You may disable your Site at any time by submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/purescript-domain/purescript-domain/edit/main/sites.yaml).

## Name Policy

Sites are generally offered on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to the Content Policy and other terms of the Agreement.

The path name must match your [registered PureScript package name](https://github.com/purescript/registry), if applicable.

In the case of a naming conflict, contact the current registrant. If you are unable to resolve it, you may [file an issue](https://github.com/purescript-domain/purescript-domain/issues/new) in the _purescript-domain_ repository. We will resolve the conflict after considering the following factors:
* when the Site was registered;
* whether the Site complies with the Agreement;
* PureScript Registry status;
* commit history age and substance, if applicable; and
* relevance as measured by GitHub stars.

## Limitation of liability

We provide the Service as-is, with no warranty of any kind and no representations concerning the suitability, reliability, accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the Service.

We expressly disclaim all warranties, expressed or implied, in connection with the Service, including conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We are not liable for direct, indirect, punitive, special, or other damages, including, without limitation, loss or delay of use, lost profits, data loss, or any other damage in contract, tort, equity, or any other legal theory, even if advised of the possibility thereof.

## Governing law and dispute resolution

Delivery and use of the Service under this Agreement are subject to the applicable laws of the State of Arizona.

You agree to and waive any objections to personal jurisdiction of and venue in the state or federal courts of Maricopa County, Arizona.

## Changes to the Agreement

We reserve the right to alter the Agreement at any time, at our sole discretion, without notice. You may return to this page periodically to review the current version of the Agreement or [monitor commit history](https://github.com/purescript-domains/purescript-domain/commits/master/homepage/src/Terms.md) on GitHub.

Continued use of the Service after changes to the Agreement indicates that you are bound by those changes. However, you can discontinue your use of the Service as described above.

## Severability

If any term or provision of the Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, then the remainder of the Agreement will remain intact.
